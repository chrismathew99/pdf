# PDF Manipulation App

Welcome to the PDF Manipulation App, a simple yet powerful tool designed to run directly in your web browser. This application allows you to perform various operations on PDF files without the need for any server-side processing. The functionalities provided include compressing PDF files, converting PDFs to Word, Image, Excel formats, and more. This guide will walk you through how to set up and use the application locally.

## Features

- **PDF Compression**: Reduce the size of your PDF files, making them easier to share and manage. Note: For any operation, including compression, click the 'Convert' button.
- **Convert PDF to Word**: Transform your PDF documents into editable Word files. (Note: Due to browser and backend processing limitations, this feature requires server-side operations not covered in this demo.)
- **Convert PDF to Image**: Turn pages of your PDF into separate image files. (Note: This requires backend processing not covered in this demo.)
- **Convert PDF to Excel**: Convert your PDF documents into Excel files for data analysis. (Note: This feature necessitates server-side operations not included in this demo.)

## System Dependencies

This application is designed to run entirely in the browser, requiring no specific system dependencies or installations. All you need is a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.

## Libraries Used

- **Bootstrap**: For styling the application and making it responsive.
- **pdf-lib**: For manipulating PDF files, including compression.
- **pdf2docx**: Intended for converting PDF files to Word documents. (Note: Not utilized in this demo due to browser limitations.)

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Download the Project**: Start by downloading the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Locate the `index.html` file in the project directory and open it with your web browser. There's no need to run a web server as the application will work directly from the file system.
3. **Explore the App**: Once opened, you'll see a simple interface where you can upload PDF files and choose the operation you wish to perform.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a PDF**: Click on the "Choose File" button and select a PDF file from your computer.
2. **Select an Operation**: Choose the operation you want to perform on your PDF file from the dropdown menu. Options include compressing the PDF or converting it to another format.
3. **Execute the Operation**: Click on the "Convert" button to start the operation. This button is used for all operations, including compression.
4. **Download the Result**: Once the operation is complete, a download link will appear in the "Conversion Results" section. Click on the link to download the processed file.

## Note

As this is a demonstration, some features are placeholders and do not perform actual conversions due to the limitations of processing PDFs purely in the browser and the necessity for server-side processing for certain conversions. For a fully functional version, these operations would need to be handled by a server-side component.
